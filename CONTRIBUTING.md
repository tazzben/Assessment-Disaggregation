# Contributing

This document outlines how you can contribute to the Assessment Disaggregation project.

## Instructors, Faculty, and Administrators 

Assessment Disaggregation allows instructors, faculty, and administrators from K-12 to universities to implement scientifically-backed measures of learning using pre- and post- tests.  We believe that better measures result in better education outcomes.  Therefore, the best contribution is use and encouraging use in your school or university. Here are some ideas:

1. Create new exam instruments and norm them for your discipline
2. Create new assessment procedures in your department
3. Examine how pre- and post- test data can be used in teaching portfolios
4. Join the assessment committee for your university

## Contributing to the Code Base

If you want to contribute a bug fix or a feature to the code base, this involves four steps.  

1. Before putting in effort, e-mail Ben Smith at ben@bensresearch.com the reason for the submission.  If this is a bug fix, this is self-explanatory.  However, if this is a feature addition, it may not be obvious all the consequences of the change and if it makes sense for the project.
2. Review the existing code in the repository.  While we donâ€™t have a strict style guide, please match the general conventions in the code.
3. Clone the repository and make the changes
4. Create a pull request fully explaining the change

## Other ways to contribute

If you want to help the project in other ways, such as documentation, please reach out to Ben Smith at ben@bensresearch.com.
